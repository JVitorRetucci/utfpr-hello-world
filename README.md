They heard from Ipiranga the placid margins
The resounding cry of a heroic people
And the sun of freedom, in bright rays
It shone in the sky of the mother country at that moment

If the pledge of such equality
We were able to conquer with a strong arm
In your bosom, O freedom
Our own chest defies death itself!

O beloved homeland.
Worshiped
Save! Save!

Brazil, an intense dream, a lively ray
From love and hope to earth descends
If in your beautiful sky, smiling and clear
The image of the cruise shines

Giant by nature
You are beautiful, you are strong, undaunted colossus
And your future mirrors this greatness

Adored earth
Among thousands
It's you, Brazil.
O beloved homeland!
Of the children of this soil you are a gentle mother
Beloved homeland
Brazil!
